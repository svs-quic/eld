Command-line options
======================

Here's the list of command-line options accepted by the ELD:

Common options for all the backends
-------------------------------------

.. include:: GnuLinkerOptions.rst

Input remapping options
-----------------------

``--remap-inputs`` and ``--remap-inputs-file`` let you redirect input file
names before ELD opens them.

``--remap-inputs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``--remap-inputs=<pattern>=<replacement>`` (or
``--remap-inputs <pattern>=<replacement>``) to add one remap rule.

Rules are evaluated in command-line order and the first matching rule wins.
``<pattern>`` supports wildcard matching.

Example::

  $ ld.eld main.o foo.o --remap-inputs=foo.o=bar.o -T script.t

In this example, any reference to ``foo.o`` is resolved as ``bar.o``.

``--remap-inputs-file``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``--remap-inputs-file=<file>`` (or ``--remap-inputs-file <file>``) to
load remap rules from a text file.

Each non-empty line in ``<file>`` defines one rule, either as:

* ``pattern=replacement``
* ``pattern replacement``

Lines starting with ``#`` (or text after ``#`` on a line) are treated as
comments.

Example::

  # remap.txt
  *foo.o build/alt/bar.o
  libold.a=libnew.a

  $ ld.eld main.o foo.o libold.a --remap-inputs-file=remap.txt -T script.t

Notes:

* Remapping is applied before path search/open, including linker-script
  ``INPUT(...)``, ``GROUP(...)``, and ``INCLUDE`` processing.
* ``--remap-inputs`` and ``--remap-inputs-file`` rules share one ordered rule
  list; whichever matching rule appears first is applied.
* To confirm remapping happened:

  - Use ``--verbose`` to see diagnostics such as
    ``Remapping input file <old> to <new>``.
  - In text map output (``-MapStyle txt``), input/load lines and linker-script
    include tracking lines are annotated with
    ``# remapped from <original-name>`` when remapping is applied.

Using ``--start-lib`` / ``--end-lib``
-------------------------------------

``--start-lib`` and ``--end-lib`` let you pass one or more object files and
have ELD treat them as if they were members of an archive for symbol resolution
purposes.

Conceptually, ELD packages the object files between ``--start-lib`` and
``--end-lib`` into an in-memory archive and then processes that archive like a
normal ``.a`` input.

Thin variant
^^^^^^^^^^^^

ELD also supports ``--start-lib-thin`` / ``--end-lib-thin``, which packages the
enclosed object files into an in-memory *thin* archive (member paths are stored
instead of embedding member bytes).

Linker scripts with archive member patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ELD supports using archive member patterns in linker scripts to match inputs
from a ``--start-lib`` region.

Internally, ELD assigns a synthetic archive name to each ``--start-lib`` region:
``<start-lib:1>``, ``<start-lib:2>``, etc., in command-line order.
Thin regions use ``<start-lib-thin:N>``.
You can reference these synthetic archive names using the standard
``archive:member`` pattern syntax in an input section description.

Example::

  $ ld.eld main.o --start-lib foo.o bar.o --end-lib -T script.t -MapStyle txt -Map out.map

  /* script.t */
  SECTIONS {
    .foo_out : { "*<start-lib:1>:*foo.o"(.text*) }
    .bar_out : { "*<start-lib:1>:*bar.o"(.text*) }
  }

Notes:

* The ``<start-lib:N>`` names are ELD-specific (they do not correspond to a
  real on-disk archive).
* If you need a stable archive name for portability, create a real archive
  (e.g. with ``ar cr libname.a ...``) and match against ``*libname.a:*member.o``
  patterns in the script.

MEMORY-related options
----------------------

When using linker scripts with ``MEMORY`` regions, these options are commonly
useful for debugging and enforcing correctness:

- ``--print-memory-usage`` prints per-region usage when a ``MEMORY`` directive
  is present in the linker script.
- ``-Wlinker-script-memory`` enables warnings for suspicious ``MEMORY`` setups
  (for example, zero-sized regions or regions that end up unused).

PIE options
-----------

ELD accepts both GNU-style single-dash and double-dash forms for PIE toggles:

- ``-pie`` and ``--pie``: create a position-independent executable.
- ``-no-pie`` and ``--no-pie``: create a non-PIE executable.

ARM and AArch64 specific options
---------------------------------

.. include:: ARMLinkerOptions.rst

Hexagon specific options
-------------------------

.. include:: HexagonLinkerOptions.rst

RISCV specific options
-----------------------

.. include:: RISCVLinkerOptions.rst

-z keyword options
-------------------

The following ``-z`` keywords are supported by ELD:

``-z combreloc``
  Combine multiple dynamic relocation sections and sort them to improve dynamic
  symbol lookup caching.

``-z nocombreloc``
  Disable relocation section combining.

``-z global``
  When building a shared object, make its symbols available for resolution by
  subsequently loaded libraries.

``-z defs``
  Report unresolved symbol references from regular object files, even when
  creating a non-symbolic shared library.

``-z initfirst``
  When building a shared object, mark it to be initialized before other objects
  loaded at the same time, and finalized after them.

``-z muldefs``
  Allow multiple definitions.

``-z nocopyreloc``
  Disable linker-generated .dynbss variables used in place of shared-library
  variables. This may result in dynamic text relocations.

``-z nodefaultlib``
  Ignore default library search paths when resolving dependencies at runtime.

``-z relro``
  Create a PT_GNU_RELRO segment and request it be made read-only after
  relocation, if supported. This is disabled by ``-z norelro``.

``-z norelro``
  Do not create a PT_GNU_RELRO segment.

``-z lazy``
  Mark the output for lazy binding (resolve function calls on first use).

``-z now``
  Mark the output for immediate binding (resolve all symbols at load time).

``-z origin``
  Require ``$ORIGIN`` handling in rpath/runpath entries.

``-z text``
  Report an error if DT_TEXTREL is set (dynamic relocations in read-only
  sections).

``-z notext``
  Allow dynamic relocations in read-only sections (do not report DT_TEXTREL).

``-z noexecstack``
  Mark the output as not requiring an executable stack.

``-z nognustack``
  Ignore ``.note.GNU-stack`` and do not create PT_GNU_STACK based on it.

``-z separate-code``
  Create a separate code PT_LOAD segment with instructions on pages disjoint
  from any other data. This is a no-op when a linker script with a ``SECTIONS``
  command is used.

``-z separate-loadable-segments``
  Place every loadable segment on pages disjoint from all other segments.

``-z noseparate-code``
  Disable separate code segment handling. This is the default behavior.

``-z execstack``
  Mark the output as requiring an executable stack.

``-z nodelete``
  Mark a shared object as non-unloadable at runtime.

``-z force-bti``
  Force GNU property BTI feature bits to be recorded (AArch64).

``-z pac-plt``
  Force GNU property PAC feature bits to be recorded for PLT use (AArch64).

``-z common-page-size=<value>``
  Set the most common page size used for segment alignment and layout
  optimization.

``-z max-page-size=<value>``
  Set the maximum supported page size used for segment alignment.

Linker version directive
------------------------

``--enable-linker-version``
  Enable the GNU linker-script ``LINKER_VERSION`` directive. When this option
  is active, every ``LINKER_VERSION`` statement encountered in a linker script
  emits a NUL-terminated string containing the eld version at that position in
  the output section. This matches the GNU ld directive and is useful for
  embedding the linker version directly into a binary. The option applies to
  the entire link once specified.

``--disable-linker-version``
  Disable the ``LINKER_VERSION`` directive. This is the default behaviour, so
  the directive is parsed but emits no data unless the feature has been
  explicitly enabled.

Record command line
-------------------

``--record-command-line``
  Record the linker command line in the ``.comment`` section. This is disabled
  by default.

``--no-record-command-line``
  Do not record the linker command line in the ``.comment`` section.
